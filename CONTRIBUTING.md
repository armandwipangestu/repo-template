## Commit Message Convention

This project uses **Conventional Commits** and is fully automated with **semantic-release**.

Correct commit messages are critical, as they determine **versioning and changelog generation**.

### Commit Format

```
<type>(optional scope): <description>
```

### Allowed Types

### Breaking Changes

Breaking changes **must** trigger a major release.

You can indicate a breaking change by:
